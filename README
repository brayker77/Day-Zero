# Bitburner – Day Zero Mode

A minimalist Bitburner script framework designed for **clean starts**: no augmentations, no Singularity access, and no Source Files beyond SF1.3.

This repo supports a fresh BitNode run with the intent to optimize:
- **Early hacking targets**
- **Contract solving**
- **Manual faction work**
- **Hacknet ROI**
- **Fastest path to first augmentation**

## 🧰 Core Goals

- 🧱 Build a reliable “Day Zero” scaffold: fast, readable, modular
- 🧠 Scripts optimized for new coders — no monoliths, no overcomplication
- 🔒 Fully compliant with low-SF environments (no corp, gang, or INT)
- 🤖 No Singularity functions — all work is manual or triggered
