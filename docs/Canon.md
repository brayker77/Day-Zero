ðŸ“š CANONICAL SOURCES

Official Scripts: https://github.com/bitburner-official/bitburner-scripts

All scaffolding, design, and terminology validated against these sources unless overridden manually

==========================================

ðŸŽ® DAY ZERO MODE â€“ OPERATIONAL ASSUMPTIONS

These assumptions govern the next BitNode run (SF1.3) and all design decisions unless overridden.

ðŸ“Œ State

Source File: SF1.3 â€” no access to SF2+, SF3, SF4

Augmentations: 0 installed

Game progress: Full reset (no rep, no corp, no INT stat)

No special memory or node carryover will be assumed

Environment: This run is developed in a new repository (bitburner-day-zero), separate from prior scaffolding

ðŸ”’ Constraints

No use of ns.singularity.* (SF4 gated)

No corp or gang systems may be scripted or referenced

No INT-based calculations (SF5 gated)

Avoid all deprecated functions (e.g., ns.nFormat)

ðŸ§° Day Zero Design Goals

Prioritize beating the game through active gameplay, not full-code automation

Optimize earliest moments of a new node (first aug ASAP)

Favor scripts that are readable and supportive, not dominant

All core scripts are provisional â€” nothing is sacred

Emphasize manual faction work, contracts, Hacknet efficiency

ðŸ§  Human-Centric Notes

Player is new to coding and will absorb passively while playing

Script design should be accessible, non-intimidating, and helpful without overreaching

Robot will generate supporting tools, handle constraints, and reduce friction

Cody is actively linked to and indexing the GitHub repository (bitburner-day-zero), and is expected to reflect this canon in all logic evaluations
